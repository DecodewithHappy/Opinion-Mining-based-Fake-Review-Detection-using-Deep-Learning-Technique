They were comfortable from the first time I put them on.  No breaking in necessary.  No rubbing anywhere.  Hiked many miles in them during our trip without a problem; great traction and didn't trap stones in the sole.  They were so comfortable I even wore them when we were not hiking.  Really like the looks of them too.  My only complaint with these shoes is the laces.  They won't stay tied unless you double knot them.\",\n",

I didn't think much of it and just ordered a new pair.  The second pair also suffered a broken strap within 2 months of normal 10 year old kid playground and school wear.  When the second strap broke  I noticed the holes on the sole where the spring attaches to the sole.<br /><br />My son really loved the shoes.  They look cool and are very springy.  They simply do not last long.  Great concept poor design.  The sole where the springs hit is about 3 millimeters thick.  Now anyone with kids knows how much the soles wear and it simply will not hold up.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />We called Sketchers customer support and they said take it back to the company store and they would replace them.  Well they didn't.  All they would do is give us a credit at the lowest price ever offered by them (or their outlet store) which was $10 less than what we paid for them.  Again buyer beware.<br /><br />My kids love Sketchers.  We love Sketchers.  We have always bought this brand from the time they started wearing shoes and have paid the sketchers premium price.  This shoe just doesn't hold up.  I am not an internet troll just want other moms and dads to avoid the problems we had.<br /><br />I will say that we live in a warm state with all year outdoor play.  Perhaps if you live in an area where kids stay indoors during the winter and they shoes are not subject to year round use they would hold up longer...but after two pairs both failing after less than 2 months of wear this appears to be a design defect inherent in the spring type shoe.\",\n",
